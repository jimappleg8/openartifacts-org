<h2>Welcome to the Open Artifacts Initiative</h2>

<p>The Open Artifacts Initiative is an informal organization dedicated to supporting and promoting the creation of Open Artifact projects.</p>

<p>Open Artifact projects are similar to open source software projects except they're not limited to software.</p>

<h3>Why a different organization?</h3>

<p>The open artifacts initiative is intended to promote and encourage open projects that are specifically designed to make the world a better place. The name comes from Buckminster Fuller, who referred to his inventions, books, and other physical "special case" manifestations of his ideas as "artifacts."</p>
